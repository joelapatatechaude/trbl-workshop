summary: "Why is this pod not being scheduled"
---
One of your colleague has containerized the famous 2048 game/puzzle, and want's to run in on the
OpenShift cluster, for his lunchbreak time of course. However this container won't schedule.

You own your colleague a few favours, so you agree to help him fix the scheduling issue. 

Let's get started!

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure />


## What's going on?
Navigate to your project (exercise03-userXX), make sure you are in the developer perspective, and pick the "Topology view" from the left pannel.


<Zoom>
![topology](/static/images/exercise3/problem.png)
</Zoom>

You may try and identify the issue. Poke around, click, explore.
If no luck after a few minutes, then check the hints below as needed.

Oh, I almost forgot. This 2048 container is running fine in the project `exercise03-readonly`.
While comparing this project with yours will not help you, you might find it usefull, at some point, to look at this project, and maybe observe a bit
the resource consumptions of this pod. I think already said too much.

Good luck!

## Hints
### Hint 1
<details>
  <summary>Check the topology view... </summary>

Have a look at the deployment information
<Zoom>
![hint1](/static/images/exercise3/hint1.png)
</Zoom>
From the message in yellow, it looks like:
- there is some quota setup
- OCP ask you to setup the CPU requests and limits for this deployment.

Note that this message is a notifica

Not sure what limits and requests are? Probably worth reading the first two paragraph of this documentation:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/



Since some quota have been applied to your namespace, OpenShift is requesting that you specify limits and/or requests for the associated resource.
In this case, no CPU limits / requests were made for the 2048 deployment, and you will have to add some. You can follow the links, check the image.
