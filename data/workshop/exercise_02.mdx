## What's going on?
Navigate to your project (exercise02-userXX), make sure you are in the developer perspective, and pick the "Topology view" from the left pannel.
The deployment is in red (sometime orange for a few seconds), so something is not right, we want this nice dark blue deployment color

## Solution


## Did you know?

### Administrator perspective
