summary: "Why is this namespace deletion stuck in 'Terminating'?"
---
After a few month of hard work, one of your colleague had successfully mastered the tic-tac-toe game, and decided
it was time to remove this game from the OpenShift cluster. He deleted the namespace, but something is wrong.
The namespace is still around, in a 'Terminating' state. He asked for your wise expertise.

Important: You will find you need to cleanup some resources. There is one in particular resource you should cleanup last,
or you will lock yourself out of this namespace. It will become clear during as long as you pay attention.

Good luck!
