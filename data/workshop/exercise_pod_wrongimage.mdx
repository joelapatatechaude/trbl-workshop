Your favorite OpenShift admin just went on mat leave, and you are now in charge of your team OpenShift cluster.
You have some user that complain they can't play pacman anymore during their lunch break, as the pod is not starting.

Let's get started!

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure />


## What's going on?
Navigate to your project (exercise01-userXX), make sure you are in the developer perspective, and pick the "Topology view" from the left pannel. The deployment is in light blue, so something is not right, we want this nice dark blue deployment color

You may try and identify the issue. Poke around, click, explore. If no luck after a few minutes, then check the hints below as needed.


## Hints
### Hint 1
<details>
  <summary>Reveal me</summary>

You can get a quick overview of the deployment situation by clicking on the deployment icon.
You can probably see some early indications of the problem.

### Hint 2
<details>
  <summary>Reveal me</summary>

You can check the deployment events.

In this case, nothing usefull (sorry). It's actually a pod issue
</details>

### Hint 3
<details>
  <summary>Reveal me</summary>

Let's check some pod information, for example, the pod logs.

![hint3](/static/images/exercise1/hint3.png)
</Zoom>
Well, nothing particularly usefull today, and that's because the pod is not even starting, so there is
no process running inside the pod, no logs being output.
</details>

### Hint 4
<details>
  <summary>Reveal me</summary>

Still in the Pods section, let's have a look at the Event.

Ok, something usefull now. The container image is not being pulled.
The error message indicate it's an authentication issue. I can guarantee you everything is fine
authentication wise, yet the message makes sense once you find the root cause.
Check very carefully the message, maybe there is a typo somewhere that may explain everything?
</details>

### Hint 5
<details>
  <summary>Reveal me</summary>

At this stage, you should understand what's going on, and have an idea on how to fix it. In the console, you should head over the Yaml
section of your deployment and update the yaml. Give it a try, and if needed, head over the solution.

</details>

## Solution
Ok, the issue is that there is a typo in the container image. OpenShift tries to pull an image that does not exist publicly.
It assumes the image must be private, and therefore trough an image around authentication. In reallity, the image does not
exists because of the typo. Let's fix that.

You could fix the pod custom resource definition, however, if the deployment is scaled down to 0, then back to 1, or if the pod
is deleted, the deployment will recreate the pod definition with ... the wrong container image name again.

So really, you need to fix the deployment definition. One way to achieve that is with the command line using `oc`, for example with
the command `oc set image ...` but in this case, we are going to edit the yaml file directly from the OpenShift console. Everything
is exlained in the next two screenshots

Your pod should now start correctly. Have a play at pacman, try to hit a highscore, read the next section, and move on to the next exercise

## Did you know?

### Administrator perspective
You can also switch to the administrator, and have access to your deployment and / or pod information under the workload menu.

### Deployment definition Yaml
Errors may be visible when inspecting the deployment definition Yaml. Have a look!

### Pod definition Yaml
Similarly, errors may be visible when inspecting the pod definition Yaml. Have a look!

## Take away
When a pod doesn't start messages may appear in various place worth checking
- Deployment's Event
- Deployment's Yaml (at the bottom)
- Pod's Event
- Pod's log (at the bottom)
- Pod's Yaml
- other places we will see in this workshop
