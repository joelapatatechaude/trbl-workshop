One of your colleague loves playing Wordle during his lunch break, but the the corporate firewall is blocking it.
He managed to containerize the game and deploy it to the OpenShift cluster, but something is wrong. He thinks
it's related to the network, and ask for your help. You love Wordle too, so you decide to give it a go and try to
fix it. Important: your colleague told you he created all the required resources, and you only need to edit one or
some of them. Hint: that's correct.

A few things to be aware of:
- There will be more than one problem to troubleshoot and fix.
- You will have edit permission only on a few OpenShift resources. That's because there are various way to fix
the problem, and for the training purpose, we will only let you fix it in some specific places.
- Your colleague created all the required resource (pod, service, route). You won't need to create / delete any
(in fact, you probably can't due to RBAC permission on this project), you just need to fix the existing one.

Good luck!

## What's going on?

You head straight to the `exercise04-userXX` namespace, pick the "Developer perspective", check the topology view, and click on the
deployment, only to find out that there is no route or service attached to this deployment. No wonder it's not working. But how to fix that?

## Hints
### Hint 1
<details>
  <summary>How to check the network resources created</summary>

You have been told network resources were created. Let's have a look. Networking is part of the "Administrator" perspective.
Change perspective, pick "Networking", and check Services, Routes, Ingresses, and NetworkPolicies. What do you see?
Does the Routes link work at all?

It looks like the "Wordle" route is using the "Wordle" service, which is good. Let's check the Service next?
