You recently heard in the news that a young kid managed to hit a theoretical Tetris High Score that triggers a bug.
This remind you of the old good time, and you managed to create all the required resource to play Tetris on your cluster (only during lunch break)
But something still not working, and your pod doesn't deploy.

Go, fix it, and slam that high score.
Good luck!

## What's going on?

You head straight to the `exercise05-userXX` namespace, pick the "Developer perspective", check the topology view. You see this
light blue deployment, and as an experienced OpenShift user, you know it should be dark blue!

<Zoom>
![topology](/static/images/exercise5/problem.png)
</Zoom>

Poke around, click, explore, and fix it!

Note: If you try to use a "lazy" shortcut solution, you may hit an error from a custom webhook admission controller.

the current yaml of the deployment.
